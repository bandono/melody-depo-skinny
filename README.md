DePo Skinny Tweaked
===================

DePo Skinny Tweaked is a modified Depo Skinny WordPress clean theme by
[Derek Powazek] [1] that I used in my [logIt] [2] blog.

I use it in combination with [flickrRSS] [3] plugin (v5.2) and
[WordPress Stats View Counter] [4] plugin (v1.2).

The first plugin is configured to show thumbnails from flickr as somekind
of header/cover image.

The second plugin is used because I love how [Jetpack] [5] counts post view
identifying real hit of desktop browsers vs bots and other agents.
A [flame icon] [6] next to view stats displayed above the post adds tweaked
look to the clean theme.
